abstract = {Context
Source code metrics are essential components in the software measurement process. They are extracted from the source code of the software, and their values allow us to reach conclusions about the quality attributes measured by the metrics.
Objectives
This paper aims to collect source code metrics related studies, review them, and perform an analysis, while providing an overview on the current state of source code metrics and their current trends.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted. A total of 226 studies, published between the years 2010 and 2015, were selected and analyzed.
Results
Almost 300 source code metrics were found. Object oriented programming is the most commonly studied paradigm with the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics, lines of code, McCabe's cyclomatic complexity, and number of methods and attributes being the most used metrics. Research on aspect and feature oriented programming is growing, especially for the current interest in programming concerns and software product lines.
Conclusions
Object oriented metrics have gained much attention, but there is a current need for more studies on aspect and feature oriented metrics. Software fault prediction, complexity and quality assessment are recurrent topics, while concerns, big scale software and software product lines represent current trends.}

abstract = {Many complex networked systems exhibit natural divisions of network nodes. Each division, or community, is a densely connected subgroup. Such community structure not only helps comprehension but also finds wide applications in complex systems. Software networks, e.g., Class Dependency Networks, are such networks with community structures, but their characteristics at the function or method call granularity have not been investigated, which are useful for evaluating and improving software intra-class structure. Moreover, existing proposed applications of software community structure have not been directly compared or combined with existing software engineering practices. Comparison with baseline practices is needed to convince practitioners to adopt the proposed approaches. In this paper, we show that networks formed by software methods and their calls exhibit relatively significant community structures. Based on our findings we propose two new class cohesion metrics to measure the cohesiveness of object-oriented programs. Our experiment on 10 large open-source Java programs validate the existence of community structures and the derived metrics give additional and useful measurement of class cohesion. As an application we show that the new metrics are able to predict software faults more effectively than existing metrics.}

abstract = {From the Publisher:As software systems become increasingly large and complex, the need increases to predict and control the effects of software changes. Software Change Impact Analysis captures the latest information on the science and art of determining what software parts affect each other. It provides a battery of ideas for doing impact analysis better, presents a framework for the field, and focuses attention on important results. You will gain a healthy respect for the strengths and limitations of impact analysis technology and a solid background that will prove valuable for years to come. The book identifies key impact analysis definitions and themes and illustrates the important themes to give you a solid understanding for tackling impact analysis problems. It includes reports on software source code dependency analysis and software traceability analysis and shows how results from both areas can more effectively support impact analysis in software engineering repositories. It also describes why impact representation and determination techniques are at the heart of both source dependency analysis and traceability analysis.}

This is due to the two major shortcomings of ICL for RE: (1) low relevance regarding entity and relation in existing sentence-level demonstration retrieval approaches for ICL; and (2) the lack of explaining input-label mappings of demonstrations leading to poor ICL effectiveness. In this paper, we propose GPT-RE to successfully address the aforementioned issues by (1) incorporating task-aware representations in demonstration retrieval; and (2) enriching the demonstrations with gold label-induced reasoning logic. We evaluate GPT-RE on four widely-used RE datasets, and observe that GPT-RE achieves improvements over not only existing GPT-3 baselines, but also fully-supervised baselines as in Figure 1. Specifically, GPT-RE achieves SOTA performances on the Semeval and SciERC datasets, and competitive performances on the TACRED and ACE05 datasets. Additionally, a critical issue of LLMs revealed by previous work, the strong inclination to wrongly classify NULL examples into other pre-defined labels, is substantially alleviated by our method. We show an empirical analysis.",
